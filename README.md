# The Half-Life HUD for Team Fortress 2

This project is still a work in progress.

If anyone wants to contribute to this project, hit me up and let's discuss.

# Features

Nothing implemented so far.

# To-do list

- Change the health and ammo icons

- Use the HL/HL2 fonts for some/all display elements

- Move health and ammo icons and text to the bottom-left corner

- Color them yellow/orange/something that represents HL2's color palette

- Recreate the hl2 crosshair, where it shows quick info about health (left bracket) and current ammo in magazine (right bracket), if possible (also I'm not sure of what to do of weapons with special abilities)

- Maybe apply an orange static-y filter over the 2D models of the mercenaries (the 3D ones I might leave them be)

- HL2 Deathmatch styled scoreboard

- Multi-resolution and aspect ratios

- Support for all gamemodes (this will require a big think)

# Download

[Latest version available here.](https://github.com/killerzman/hl-hud-for-tf2/archive/master.zip)

# Installation

Once you've downloaded the zip archive, extract the hlhudfortf2 folder (NOT THE hl-hud-for-tf2-master FOLDER!!!) in [TF2 DIRECTORY]/tf/custom (Default directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom).

If you don't have a custom folder, create one yourself.

I am not responsible of conflicts with other HUDs/mods, so be sure to disable/delete them before trying this one/complaining to me.

# Screenshots

I will update this section once I have important updates to showcase. Nothing yet of importance.
