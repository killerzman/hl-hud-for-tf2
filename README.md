# The Half-Life HUD for Team Fortress 2

This project is still a work in progress.

If anyone wants to contribute to this project, hit me up and let's discuss.

# Features

Nothing implemented so far.

# To-do list

- Change the health and ammo icons

- Use the HL/HL2 fonts for some/all display elements

- Move health and ammo icons and text to the bottom-left corner

- Color them yellow/orange/something that represents HL2's color palette

- Recreate the hl2 crosshair, where it shows quick info about health (left bracket) and current ammo in magazine (right bracket), if possible (also I'm not sure of what to do of weapons with special abilities)

- Maybe apply an orange static-y filter over the 2D models of the mercenaries (the 3D ones I might leave them be)

- HL2 Deathmatch styled scoreboard

- Multi-resolution and aspect ratios

- Support for all gamemodes (this will require a big think)
